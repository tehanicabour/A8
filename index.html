            <p style="text-align: center; font-size:; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:50%; text-align: justify;">This infographic depicts the states of different sectors of the stock market a week leading to the failure of the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), and a week after the event. Because this phenomenon had such a strong impact on the market, it is reasonable to conclude any dramatic changes in stock prices between March 3rd 2023 and March 16th 2023 are a direct result of SVBâ€™s collapse. As a way to gauge the general health of the different sectors, this infographic includes data of only S&P500 company stocks (often referenced in determining the overall state of the US stock market). I found this event particularly interesting to depict for two main reasons: 1) it marks the second greatest bank failure in the US since the 2008 recession, and 2) the state of the stock market has been much more volatile ever since Covid-19, so seeing its response to such an event may help us better understand it. I hope users will gain a better understand about not just the bank failure in itself, but how widespread its impact has been on our economy, and how this reflects the fragile state of the financial market.</p>

            <p style="text-align: center; font-size:; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:50%; text-align: justify;">I was at first surprised to see that 31.8% of the USA population got COVID, and that 0.9% of cases are ongoing (probably more so a result of less tests taken nowadays). The 0.3% mortality rate must also be due to tests still being regularly taken (especially by healthcare workers), but deaths from COVID are extremely rare nowadays. The statistic that demonstrates the overall ratio of COVID cases outcomes (death vs recovery) least surprised me, as 1% seems to be the overall consensus on the cumulative mortality rate.</p>
